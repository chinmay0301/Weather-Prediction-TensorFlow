# Weather-Prediction-TensorFlow
A basic weather prediction software powered using TensorFlow. The aim is to try out a few Neural Network models to predict the weather depending on parameters like time of the year, location, wind speed, precipitation etc.

The first idea is to use a simple feed forward Neural Network. This will be replaced by a Recurrent Neural Network eventually.
